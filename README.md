Tired of having problems with my electric company for low or high voltage issues, I decided to build this power voltage meter and logger using an ESP8266 WEMOS Mini D1 and a Zmpt101b module.
This device constantly measures the voltage of the power outlet and displays it on a small LCD display. It also sends the measurements to an Adafruit IO log so that variations over time can be viewed.
I also added some leds to include status and error indications and a control button to manage some actions such as turn on display backlight, reset and other future features.
